Hi, I’m Xufen Tu.

I spend most of my time trying to understand how people think, decide, and stay balanced in a world that’s moving faster than our brains were originally designed for.  
None of this came from a formal field — it came from years of observing real decisions, real pressure, and the way humans adapt when the environment becomes confusing.

My work always starts from one place:  
“How does a human stay clear, stable, and self-directed in a system full of noise?”

From there，我慢慢形成了一些自己的路径与结构：  
- how cognitive evolution happens in everyday life  
- how people regain clarity when decisions get too complicated  
- how identity stays intact under digital systems  
- how emotional states influence long-term choices  
- how humans interact with automated systems without losing themselves

这些不是书上来的，而是我自己长期实践、记录、推敲得出的经验。  
很多模型、想法、词语，最初都只是我在不同国家生活时写下的笔记，  
后来串起来，变成了我探索的几个方向：  
认知进化、人类中心的系统架构、数字身份安全、决策路径、以及跨学科的未来研究。

I treat this repository as my “thinking archive”—  
a place to leave traces of how I build ideas, what I observe, and how each concept gradually forms its structure.  
Everything here is written, revised, and explained by me personally.  
If someone finds these ideas useful in the future, I hope they can also trace them back to their original context:  
a human trying to understand how humans work.

If you’re working on similar questions — cognition, identity, future systems, or simply how to stay human in an automated era — feel free to say hello.  
I’m always open to conversations about how people think, learn, and evolve.
Most of what I write comes from long periods of living in different countries,
observing how people adapt to pressure, and trying to understand my own mind along the way.
If one day someone finds value in these ideas, I hope they can feel the human trail behind them —
the notes, the doubts, the experiments, and the small pieces of clarity collected on the road.
